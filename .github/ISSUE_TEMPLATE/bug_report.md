<!--
  If you answered "Bug report":

    We expect you to produce a high-quality bug report since putting care into your report helps us fix the issue faster.
    For bug reports, it is REQUIRED to fill the rest of this template, or the issue will be closed.

  If you answered "Feature request" or "Question":

    Make sure to describe as precisely as possible the feature you'd like to see implemented or the question you'd like to see answered.
    When relevant, provide visual examples (screenshots, screencasts, diagrams...).
    You can ignore the next steps as long as you've made sure that your description is as clear, thorough and illustrated as possible.

- [] I have reviewed [the documentation](https://github.com/EkoLabs/react-native-background-downloader/blob/master/README.md) in its entirety, including the dedicated documentations :books:.
